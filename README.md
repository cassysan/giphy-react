This is a very simple GIPHY application. It calls the GIPHY Api, and you can select whatever image/gif you want from the list on the right into the main dif.

It is written in React to show basic knowledge level.

Here are some dependencies you need in order to run the program locally:
1.) Node-Sass
    The App CSS sheet is saved in SCSS, so you must install this
2.) Giphy Api
    You must have this installed to the program to run the api calls.
    In order to make it work locally, you will have to make an account with Giphy Developers to secure your own API string.
